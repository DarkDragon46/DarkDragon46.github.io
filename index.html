<h1>About myself 🙋‍♂️</h1>
My name is Bill(y) and I like to make my life easier with the tools I create. I enjoy to play and collect (retro!) videogames, have cool physical builds, exploring new music and love learning about space! On this website I like to share my projects with the outside world to enjoy. Thanks for visiting!

<h1>Projects</h1>
I like to create projects and develop my skills digitally and physically. Here are some of my projects that I like to share and I'm really proud of 🦾.
